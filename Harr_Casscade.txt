OpenCV uses the Haar cascade algorithm to detect faces using XML cascade files. This algorithm was proposed by Viola and Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. The algorithm uses a set of simple features that are efficient to compute, and a cascade of classifiers that progressively filters out non-object regions in the image. The Haar cascade classifier works by applying a set of rectangular filters to an image at different scales and locations, and then using the resulting values to classify the region as either object or non-object. The XML cascade files in OpenCV contain the trained classifier parameters that are used to detect faces in images or video streams.
